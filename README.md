# SyNERGY: An energy measurement and prediction framework for convolutional neural  networks (or ConvNets) on ARM mobile platforms

This framework can be used to provide per-layer energy and performance measurements in a pre-trained Caffe/Caffe2 ConvNet model.

Tested platforms: 
-Jetson TX1: Ubuntu 16.04
-Snapdragon 820: Android 7.0

Tested software frameworks
- Caffe + OpenBLAS backend
- Caffe2 + Eigen backend
